Simple CSS tweak that changes to default coloring of "OK" Hosts in the Hostoverview to the default CheckMK CI colors

Create a new folder in  ```/omd/sites/monitoring/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/themes/``` and add themes.css and themes.json to it. 
It will create a new theme with the name declared in the .JSON file
